duration: 2 minutes
steps:
- Prepare the Kalita Wave on top of a mug or carafe, insert a paper filter, rinse the filter, then pour in the ground coffee. Shake the Kalita Wave so that the bed of coffee is flat. This makes it easier to saturate all of the grounds with water.
- Pour 50 grams of water over the bed of coffee. Wait until 0:30.
- Pour 50 grams of water at 0:30, 1:00, 1:30, and 2:00.
- Let the coffee draw down until most of it has left the cup. Typically, I remove the Kalita Wave from the top of the cup after three minutes.
