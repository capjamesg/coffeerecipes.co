<p>When I started making speciality coffee, I was overwhelmed at the recipes available. I wanted a recipe that would "just work" from which I could start exploring. I started with Stumptown's delightful YouTube videos, then found my way to James Hoffmann. I found recipes that worked for me: the dependable ones to which I could go day in and day out.</p>

<p>This website is dedicated to sharing coffee recipes in a simple format, easy for you to refer to while you are making a coffee. Where jargon is used ("what is a bloom?!"), we link to our <a href="/glossary">Glossary</a>.</p>

<p>The recipes here have been used as daily drivers, or come highly recommended by, the authors. We provide ways to filter recipes by volume, brewing device, and grinder.</p>

<p>Grinder and brewer listings are written by <a href="https://jamesg.blog">James</a>, the owner of this website. Companies cannot pay to be listed or to have their listing changed in any way.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the website!</p>

<p>This website is made with love, and of course coffee, by <a href="https://jamesg.blog">James' Coffee Blog</a></p>
